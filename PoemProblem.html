    <h1>Trees</h1>
    <pre>
        I think that I shall never see<br>
        A poem lovely as a tree.<br>
        A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br>
        Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;<br>
        A tree that looks at God all day,<br>
        And lifts her leafy arms to pray;<br>
        A tree that may in Summer wear<br>
        A nest of robins in her hair;<br>
        Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br>
        Who intimately lives with rain.<br>
        Poems are made by fools like me,<br>
        But only God can make a tree.
